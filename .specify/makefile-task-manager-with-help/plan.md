## Summary
Enhance the Makefile to serve as an effective task manager by making the help target the default, ensuring all user-facing targets have descriptions, and configuring bash completion for make commands in the toolbox environment. The existing help target (lines 32-36) already formats and displays task descriptions using `##` comments. Changes needed: (1) make help the default target, (2) verify all targets have descriptions, (3) ensure bash-completion is loaded in toolbox bashrc configuration.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: GNU Make 4.x, Bash 5.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: GNU Stow, bash-completion package  
**Storage**: N/A (configuration files only)  
**Testing**: Manual verification via `make help`, tab completion testing  
**Target Platform**: Fedora Silverblue (atomic OS), toolbox containers  
**Project Type**: Single (dotfiles management system)  
**Performance Goals**: Instant help display (<100ms), sub-second completion  
**Constraints**: Must work in toolbox environment, survive toolbox resets, no host modifications beyond stowed dotfiles  
**Scale/Scope**: ~15 user-facing Makefile targets, 4 bash config files in dot-bashrc.d/

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Declarative Configuration ✅ PASS
**Assessment**: Changes are purely declarative - modifying Makefile target order and adding bash completion sourcing in configuration files. No imperative scripts needed.
**Alignment**: Help target already uses declarative grep/awk pattern. Bash completion is a declarative load of existing system files.

### II. Stow-Based Management ✅ PASS
**Assessment**: All changes live in Stow-managed directories (dot-bashrc.d/). Makefile orchestration preserved and enhanced.
**Alignment**: No new deployment mechanisms introduced. Makefile remains primary orchestration layer with clear help target.

### III. Toolbox Isolation ✅ PASS
**Assessment**: Bash completion configuration belongs in toolbox (where make commands run). Uses existing bash-completion package already installed.
**Alignment**: No host system changes. Configuration via stowed dotfiles to ~/.bashrc.d/ (toolbox environment).

### IV. Systemd-First Automation ✅ PASS
**Assessment**: Not applicable - this feature is about interactive task discovery, not background automation.
**Alignment**: N/A

### V. Neovim-Centric Workflow ✅ PASS
**Assessment**: Not applicable - this feature enhances command-line workflow, complementary to editor.
**Alignment**: N/A

**Overall**: ✅ PASS - All applicable principles satisfied. No violations.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project (dotfiles management) - no backend/frontend split.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Current State Analysis
**Existing Implementation Discovered**:
1. ✅ Help target exists (Makefile lines 32-36) with formatted output
2. ✅ Pattern `target: ## description` is established convention
3. ✅ Color formatting implemented (cyan for target names)
4. ✅ Alphabetical sorting in help output via `sort` command
5. ✅ bash-completion package installed (bash-completion-2.16-1.fc42.noarch)
6. ✅ System make completion script exists at `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/make`
7. ✅ Bashrc loads ~/.bashrc.d/* files automatically (stowed from dot-bashrc.d/)

**Gaps Identified**:
1. ❌ Default target is `default:` (line 26), not `help:`
2. ❌ Default target comment `## stow dotfiles` doesn't show full picture (also runs init, fonts)
3. ❌ No bash completion loader in dot-bashrc.d/ for make commands
4. ⚠️  Some targets may lack `##` descriptions (needs verification)

**Research Findings**:
- **Decision**: Use bash-completion package's built-in make completion
- **Rationale**: Already installed, maintained by distribution, handles Makefile target parsing automatically
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom completion script (rejected - unnecessary complexity)

**Research Findings - Default Target**:
- **Decision**: Make `help` the first non-special target in Makefile
- **Rationale**: First non-dot-prefixed target becomes default. Moving `help:` before current `default:` makes help the default.
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - `.DEFAULT_GOAL = help` directive (rejected - less explicit)
  - Rename targets (rejected - breaks existing workflows)

**Output**: No separate research.md needed - all patterns well-established.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Design Decisions

#### 1. Makefile Reorganization
**Current Structure**:
```makefile
default: # init fonts ## stow dotfiles
    [commands]

help: ## show this help
    [commands]
```

**New Structure**:
```makefile
help: ## show available make targets
    [existing commands - no changes]

default: ## install dotfiles (runs init, stow)
    [existing commands - no changes]
```

**Justification**: First target becomes default. Improved description clarifies what `default` actually does.

#### 2. Bash Completion Configuration
**New File**: `dot-bashrc.d/completion.sh`
```bash
# Load bash completion for make and other tools
if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
fi
```

**Justification**: 
- Loads bash-completion framework which auto-loads `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/make`
- Conditional check makes it safe if package not installed
- Follows existing pattern in dot-bashrc.d/ (single-purpose files)
- Works in toolbox environment where make commands run

#### 3. Target Description Audit
**Action Required**: Verify all user-facing targets have `##` descriptions.

**Current Targets with Descriptions** (from make help output):
- backup_disable, backup_enable, backup_status, backup_test ✅
- copilot, default, delete, help ✅
- task, tbx_disable, tbx_enable, tbx_status, tbx_test ✅

**Internal Targets** (no `##` expected):
- init, clean_nvim, ai (internal/maintenance tasks)

**Result**: All user-facing targets already have descriptions. ✅

### Quickstart Verification Steps
Generated: `quickstart.md` with manual test scenarios

### Agent File Update
**Action**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
**Expected Output**: Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with:
- Recent change: "Enhanced Makefile help as default target"
- Context: bash-completion setup for toolbox
- Keep under 150 lines per constitution requirement

**Output**: quickstart.md, updated .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
1. **Setup Tasks**: Create completion.sh file
2. **Makefile Modification Tasks**: Reorder targets (help before default), update descriptions
3. **Deployment Tasks**: Stow changes, verify in toolbox
4. **Verification Tasks**: Test help output, test tab completion, test default behavior
5. **Documentation Tasks**: Update README if needed

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Sequential: Create files → Modify Makefile → Deploy → Verify
- No parallelization needed (small change set, dependencies exist)
- TDD approach: Define expected outcomes before changes

**Estimated Output**: 8-10 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, verify in toolbox)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations detected - this section is empty. ✅

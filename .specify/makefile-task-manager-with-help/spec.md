# Feature Specification: Makefile Task Manager with Help Target

**Feature Branch**: `makefile-task-manager-with-help`  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "use Makefile as a task manager. A help target lists tasks with description. Ensure make autocompletion is set up in the toolbox"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature focuses on: task management, help display, autocompletion
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers/users working in the toolbox environment
   ‚Üí Actions: run tasks, view available tasks, use tab completion
   ‚Üí Data: task names, descriptions
   ‚Üí Constraints: toolbox environment, existing Makefile
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All aspects are clear from description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flow: view help, run tasks, use completion
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Key entity: Makefile targets with descriptions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details (HOW)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Focused on user needs (WHAT/WHY)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer working in the toolbox environment needs to discover available Makefile tasks, understand what each task does, and efficiently execute tasks using command-line completion. Currently, the Makefile has a `help` target (line 32-36) that displays formatted task descriptions, but the user needs assurance that:
1. All tasks have proper descriptions visible in help output
2. Tab completion works for make commands within the toolbox
3. The help output is the default when running `make` with no arguments

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer in the toolbox shell, **When** they type `make` with no arguments or `make help`, **Then** they see a formatted list of all available tasks with descriptions
2. **Given** a developer in the toolbox shell, **When** they type `make <TAB>`, **Then** bash completion suggests all available Makefile targets
3. **Given** any Makefile target intended for user invocation, **When** viewing `make help`, **Then** that target appears with a clear description
4. **Given** a developer reading the help output, **When** they see a task name, **Then** the description clearly explains the task's purpose in under 10 words

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a new target is added without a `##` description comment?
  ‚Üí It should not appear in help output (only documented targets are shown)
- How does the system handle targets intended for internal use only?
  ‚Üí Internal targets have no `##` comment and won't appear in help
- What if bash-completion package is not installed in the toolbox?
  ‚Üí Autocompletion fails gracefully; user can still type full target names

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a help message listing all user-facing Makefile targets with descriptions when `make help` is invoked
- **FR-002**: The help target MUST be the default target so `make` with no arguments shows help output
- **FR-003**: Each user-facing Makefile target MUST include an inline comment in format `target: ## description` for help discovery
- **FR-004**: The help output MUST be formatted with aligned columns (target name left, description right)
- **FR-005**: Bash completion for make commands MUST be functional within the toolbox environment
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to press TAB after typing `make` to see available target completions
- **FR-007**: The autocompletion setup MUST persist across toolbox resets and new toolbox sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear documentation on how help and completion work for future maintainers
- **FR-009**: The help format MUST use color coding (cyan for target names) to improve readability
- **FR-010**: All existing targets (`backup_enable`, `backup_disable`, `tbx_enable`, etc.) MUST retain their `##` descriptions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Makefile Target**: A task definition in the Makefile consisting of a target name, optional dependencies, and associated commands. User-facing targets have a `## description` comment for help visibility.
- **Help Output**: Formatted text display showing target names aligned with their descriptions, extracted via grep pattern matching on `## ` comments.
- **Bash Completion Configuration**: Shell configuration that enables tab completion for make target names, typically provided by bash-completion package and loaded in `.bashrc` or bash configuration snippets.
